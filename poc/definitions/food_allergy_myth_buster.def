question do
  statement <<-eos
    A food intolerance is just a less severe type of allergy
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    Food allergy and food intolerance are quite different things. A
    food allergy is a reaction produced by the body’s immune system
    when it encounters a normally harmless substance. This tends to
    happen relatively quickly, sometimes within minutes, but more
    likely within 1-2 hours. An intolerance does not usually involve
    the immune system and is when a foodstuff (such as lactose)
    causes an unpleasant reaction (such as diarrhoea) and effects are
    rarely immediate. People who have allergies will have a bad
    reaction even if they come into contact with a very small amount
    of the foodstuff they are allergic to, whereas those with an
    intolerance may still be able to eat that foodstuff in small
    quantities.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    If you think you have an allergy or intolerance to a certain
    food, you should cut it out of your diet
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    Don't cut food groups out of your diet without medical advice,
    because you could miss out on important nutrients. Consult your
    GP first, who can refer you for tests to diagnose your symptoms
    if appropriate.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Levels of food allergy are rising
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    It is thought that allergies to food are rising. For instance,
    the number of children admitted to hospital for food-related
    anaphylaxis has risen by 700% since 1990. Food allergy is thought
    to affect 5-8% of young children and 3-4% of adults. It is not
    known why allergies are rising, but theories include changes in
    diet and improved levels of hygiene, which leave children’s
    immune systems underexposed to germs.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Most children grow out of their allergy to eggs, milk, wheat and
    soya
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    It is true that most children will grow out of their allergy to
    eggs, milk, wheat and soya – generally by about the age of five.
    It is thought to be as a result of the gut maturing or a change
    in the immune system’s response to that food.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Most people will grow out of allergies to peanuts, seafood, fish
    and tree nuts
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    An allergy to peanuts, seafood, fish and tree nuts is very rarely
    lost.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    You can be allergic to any foodstuff
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    This is true in theory, but in fact just a handful of foods are
    to blame for 90% of allergic reactions to food in the UK. They
    are: celery, cereals containing gluten (including wheat, rye,
    barley and oats), crustaceans (including crabs and prawns), eggs,
    fish, lupin, milk, molluscs (such as mussels and oysters),
    mustard, nuts (including brazil nuts, hazelnuts, almonds and
    walnuts), peanuts (groundnuts or monkey nuts), sesame seeds,
    soya, sulphur dioxide or sulphites.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Symptoms of an allergic reaction will always appear immediately
    after eating the food that caused it
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    It may be that symptoms of an allergic reaction appear
    immediately, but it can be several hours before they present
    themselves. It is also the case that symptoms can be more or less
    severe on different occasions.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Food allergies can be fatal
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    People with allergies can have a reaction called anaphylaxis (
    pronounced anna-fill-axis), sometimes called anaphylactic shock.
    Anaphylaxis can be fatal if it isn't treated immediately, usually
    with an injection of adrenaline (epinephrine). This is why it's
    extremely important for someone with an allergy to take their
    medication with them wherever they go.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Some people can be allergic to fruit and vegetables
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    This can happen in some people who have hay fever and are
    sensitive to pollen or in people who are allergic to latex.
    Symptoms generally include itches or rashes around the mouth and
    lips, which is why this type of allergy is called oral allergy
    syndrome. Cooking can destroy the allergens that cause this type
    of reaction, so a person who has an allergic reaction to raw
    apples may be able to eat cooked apples. The reverse can also be
    true, with some cooked vegetables being more allergenic than raw,
    for example celery or celeriac.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    A food allergy or intolerance can be easily self-diagnosed
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    It is thought that a much higher number of people will believe
    that their symptoms are being caused by a food allergy or
    intolerance than is actually the case. Around 30% believe they
    are allergic or intolerant to one or more foods, but a Food
    Standards Agency (FSA) report in 2008 estimated that only 5-8% of
    children and 1-2% of adults have a food allergy. Some researchers
    believe that the figure for adults may be slightly higher, at
    around 3-4%. Always consult with your GP first if you are
    experiencing symptoms.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Food allergies or intolerances can be cured
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    There is currently no cure for food allergy or intolerances. The
    only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid the food you are
    sensitive to. Research is under way to see if desensitisation
    strategies (as are used for hay fever) can also be applied to
    food allergies, but this is still at an early stage and should
    not be attempted without close medical supervision. If you think
    you may have a food allergy or intolerance, it is important to
    visit your GP before you start cutting out foods. Many children
    will grow out of their allergies and intolerances as their bodies
    and immune systems mature

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Home test kits are recommended for diagnosing food allergies and
    intolerances
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    The use of commercial allergy testing kits is not recommended.
    These tests are often of a lower standard than those provided by
    the NHS or accredited private clinics. Also, allergy tests should
    be interpreted by a qualified professional who has detailed
    knowledge of your symptoms and medical history.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Allergies and intolerances run in families
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    If you have parents or a sibling with an allergic condition, such
    as eczema, asthma or a food allergy, you are at a higher risk of
    developing a food allergy or intolerance. However, you may not
    develop the same allergy.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    If you have eczema or asthma you are more likely to develop an
    allergy or intolerance
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    Children who are born with other allergic conditions, such as
    asthma or atopic dermatitis (an allergic skin condition), are
    more likely to develop a food allergy.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    You are only required to carry medication if your allergy is very
    severe
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    If you are diagnosed with a food allergy you should carry
    medication with you at all times, since an allergic reaction can
    range in severity. Your GP will provide you with two types of
    medication: antihistamine tablets and/or gels, which can be used
    to manage the symptoms of a mild to moderate allergic reaction,
    and adrenaline, which is used to manage the symptoms of
    anaphylaxis. Adrenaline is normally supplied in a device called
    an adrenaline auto-injector pen.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    People who have a food allergy are more likely to develop other food allergies
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    This is known as being ‘atopic’ and refers to a tendency to
    develop allergies. Being atopic can mean you react to a number of
    unrelated allergens, for example peanuts and cats. Other people
    can react to different foods that contain either the same
    allergen or an allergen with a very similar structure, which
    means they can cause similar allergic reactions. This is known as
    allergic cross-reactivity. This means that if someone is allergic
    to peanuts, they might react to other foods in the legume family
    such as soya, peas, lentils, lupin and beans.

end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    If you have a food allergy or intolerance you may have an
    allergic reaction to cosmetics
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    If you have an allergy it is important to train yourself to read
    labels on everything that comes into contact with your body – not
    just the food that you eat. For instance, some cosmetics may
    contain nut oils or extracts of fruit or vegetables.
