question do
  statement <<-eos
    Women are affected by alcohol to the same degree as men.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    Men have a higher average total body water content than women
    (62% compared to 52%), meaning men are better able to dilute
    alcohol than women. Other factors have also been reported that can
    make women more sensitive to alcohol, such as enzyme differences.
    All these factors mean that women are more at risk than men from
    the same level of drinking.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Drinking water can lesson the effects of a hangover.
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    While food and water may ease some of the symptoms, they won't cure
    a hangover. The best way to avoid one is to moderate your drinking
    and have water between alcoholic drinks. Remember that water won't
    make you any less drunk or protect your liver.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    A cold shower, fresh air or hot coffee will sober someone up.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    You might feel less sleepy, but only time will get alcohol out of
    your body. Depending on your weight, it takes about one hour to
    process one unit of alcohol.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Alcohol is fattening.
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    There can be almost 200 calories in a large glass of red wine. And
    any sugar in mixers or cocktails comes on top of the alcohol
    content of the spirits. Alcohol also reduces our self-control,
    making it easy to eat too much.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Alcohol is a stimulant.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    Alcohol is actually a depressant.  Initially, you may feel more
    energetic or cheerful because alcohol depresses your inhibitions.
    However, that means you can also be less able to control your
    emotions or reactions.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Beer gets you less drunk.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    An average pint of beer (ABV 5%), large glass of wine (250ml,
    ABV 11%) or a ‘large’ double vodka (70ml, ABV 38 to 40%) all have
    around 2.8 units of alcohol. This is what makes you drunk
    chemically, and the faster you drink the full 2.8 units, the higher
    your peak blood level. But there are a wide range of factors that
    can affect how drunk you feel including your expectations.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Lining your stomach with a big meal before drink can help to reduce
    the risk of getting drunk.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    Drinking on a full stomach before you go out will delay alcohol
    getting into your system, not prevent it. A meal will only delay
    the rate of alcohol absorption, but if you go on to drink heavily
    you will get drunk. However, it's still best to eat a proper meal
    before a night out, especially foods rich in carbohydrates and
    proteins.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Switching between beer, wine, and spirits will make you more drunk.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    Your blood alcohol content is what determines how drunk you are.
    Mixing drinks may make you sicker by upsetting your stomach, but
    not more intoxicated.
  eos
end

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Your body develops a tolerance to alcohol, so you can safely drink
    more.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    The more you drink the more damage your body will sustain and the
    greater the risks become. Tolerance can actually be seen as a
    warning sign that your body has started to be affected by alcohol.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Drinking more than a glass of wine a day may reduce your chances of
    getting pregnant.
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    Women who drink a lot find it more difficult to conceive. A study
    reported by the British Medical Journal found that as few as five
    drinks every week may decrease a woman's chance of becoming
    pregnant. If you want to conceive, it's probably best to avoid
    alcohol completely.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    White wine is a good choice for a person who wants a light drink
    with less alcohol.
  eos

  answer false

  explanation <<-eos
    A glass of white or red wine, a bottle of beer and a shot of
    whiskey or other distilled spirits can all contain equivalent
    amounts of alcohol, depending on actual drink size and strength
    and will give similar readings on a breathalyzer.

question do
  statement <<-eos
    Drinking too much alcohol can reduce male fertility.
  eos

  answer true

  explanation <<-eos
    Alcohol decreases fertility by its effect on sperm quality and
    quantity. Men trying for a family may want to consider reducing
    their overall alcohol consumption.
