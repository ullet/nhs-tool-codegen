          Women are affected by alcohol to the same degree as men.
        eos

        answer false

        explanation <<-eos
          Men have a higher averag total body water content than women (62%
          compared to 52% ), meaning men are better able to dilute alcohol than
          women. Other factors have also been reported that can make women more
          sensitive to alcohol, such as enzyme differences. All these factors mean
          that women are more at risk than men from the same level of drinking.

          Drinking water can lesson the effects of a hangover.
        eos

        answer true

        explanation <<-eos
          While food and water may ease some of the symptoms, they won't cure a
          hangover. The best way to avoid one is to moderate your drinking and
          have water between alcoholic drinks. Remember that water won't make you
          any less drunk or protect your liver.
