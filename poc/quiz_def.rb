# Women are affected by alcohol to the same degree as men.
# EOT
#       answer = false
#       explanation = << EOT
# Men have a higher average total body water content than women (62%
# compared to 52% ), meaning men are better able to dilute alcohol than
# women. Other factors have also been reported that can make women more
# sensitive to alcohol, such as enzyme differences. All these factors mean
# that women are more at risk than men from the same level of drinking.

# Drinking water can lesson the effects of a hangover.
# EOT
#       answer = true
#       explanation = << EOT
# While food and water may ease some of the symptoms, they won't cure a
# hangover. The best way to avoid one is to moderate your drinking and
# have water between alcoholic drinks. Remember that water won't make you
# any less drunk or protect your liver.
